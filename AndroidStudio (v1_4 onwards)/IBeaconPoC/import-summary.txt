ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From IBeaconPoC:
* README.md
* proguard-project.txt
From google-play-services_lib:
* README.txt
* proguard.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In android-beacon-library:
* AndroidManifest.xml => androidbeaconlibrary/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => androidbeaconlibrary/src/main/assets/
* libs/classes.jar => androidbeaconlibrary/libs/classes.jar
* res/ => androidbeaconlibrary/src/main/res/
* src/ => androidbeaconlibrary/src/main/java/
In google-play-services_lib:
* AndroidManifest.xml => googleplayservices_lib/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => googleplayservices_lib/src/main/assets/
* libs/google-play-services.jar => googleplayservices_lib/libs/google-play-services.jar
* lint.xml => googleplayservices_lib/lint.xml
* res/ => googleplayservices_lib/src/main/res/
* src/ => googleplayservices_lib/src/main/java/
In IBeaconPoC:
* AndroidManifest.xml => IBeaconPoC/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => IBeaconPoC/src/main/assets/
* libs/android-support-v4.jar => IBeaconPoC/libs/android-support-v4.jar
* lint.xml => IBeaconPoC/lint.xml
* res/ => IBeaconPoC/src/main/res/
* src/ => IBeaconPoC/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
